# Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
## OVERVIEW
In this project, I analyzed the sales performance of a retail store based on the products sold across various regions in 2023 & 2024 using Excel, SQL and Power BI to draw interesting insights and to give a sum up of the data.

## Data Collected 
The data set includes the following key columns:
- Product: contains the various products sold in this retail store, e.g; Hat, Shoes, e.t.c.
- Region: different regions where the product were sold(West, East, North and South)
- Orderdate: when the products were sold.
- Quantity: how many product was purchased by each customer.
- UnitPrice: the price each product was sold for.
